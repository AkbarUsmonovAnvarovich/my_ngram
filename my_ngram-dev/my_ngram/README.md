# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
The first that i faced during the project was how print all char in ascii order.

## Description
I saw some tutorals and one idea came to my mind using in array by value ascii.

## Installation
In this project i did not use npm because i am coding in C language.

## Usage
It works very simple you just have to give argument by this order
e.g 
1 make
2 [filename] XXX XXX XXX ... so on.
